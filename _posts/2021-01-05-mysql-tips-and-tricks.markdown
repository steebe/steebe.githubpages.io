# MySQL - Helpful Tidbits

My experiences at Rev360 (RevolutionEHR) and Mercato brought about developing for back-ends that leverage MySQL for data storage solutions. All my other previous experiences were within the context of Oracle, DB2, and SQL Server database technologies, and I found myself constantly Googling to see how to do things better in MySQL. Below are some of those findings.

### Perform batch UPDATEs with a temp table

When performing ```UPDATE```s against a table in bulk, MySQL is pretty non-performant when given a raw ```UPDATE``` statement with a ```WHERE``` clause:

{% highlight sql %}
  UPDATE A
    SET foo = 'bar' WHERE id < 1000;
{% endhighlight %}

The best way of handling bulk ```UPDATE```s turns out to be establishing a temp table containing the values that encapsulate the data for the ```UPDATE```, and then performing the ```UPDATE``` with a ```JOIN``` against the temporary table.

{% highlight sql %}
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `tempFooValues`;

  CREATE TABLE `tempFooValues` (
    `id` INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `foo` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(`id`)
  );

  INSERT INTO tempFooValues (id, foo) VALUES
  (1, 'bar'),
  (2, 'bar'),
  ...,
  ...,
  (1000, 'bar');

  UPDATE A
    INNER JOIN tempFooValues ON tempFooValues.id = A.id
  SET
    A.foo = tempFooValues.foo;

{% endhighlight %}

### Leveraging CASE within a JOIN

This one is pretty self-explanatory...

{% highlight sql %}
  SELECT * FROM A
  JOIN B
    ON CASE
       WHEN B.type IN (1, 3) AND B.a_id = A.id THEN 1
       WHEN B.type IN (2) AND B.other_id = A.other_id THEN 1
       ELSE 0
       END = 1;
{% endhighlight %}
