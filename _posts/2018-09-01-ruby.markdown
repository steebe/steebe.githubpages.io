# Notes

## Data Types
* Numbers - You know, the ususal. (40, 1.3, 6969696...)
{% highlight ruby %}
x = 3
y = 2.9
{% endhighlight %}
* Strings - Again, do we need to go over this? ("Steve", "is", "dumb"...)
{% highlight ruby %}
name = "steebe"
{% endhighlight %}
* Booleans
{% highlight ruby %}
5 < 10          # => true
5     <= 10     # => true
'abc' == 'def'  # => false
true            # => true
123456          # => true
0               # => true
nil             # => false
'xyz'.empty?    # => false
'a' > 5         # => error:
                # comparison of String with
                # Numeric failed
{% endhighlight %}
* Arrays - A list of items whose initial value is denoted with brackets ([]) (index access similar to Python => arr[0] returns the first item of arr)
{% highlight ruby %}
arr = [1, 2, 3]
{% endhighlight %}
* Hashes - A map; a list of key value pairs (similar to Python dict)
{% highlight ruby %}
h = {"key" => "value", "name" => "steebe"}
{% endhighlight %}
* Symbols - A static constant of sorts. The syntax of a symbol in code is _:<symbol-name>_ (:symbolA, :mysymbol, :etc). The symbol can be reused over and over, and memory is only allocated once for its representation. Its underlying representation, by the way, is a string when it is consumed.
{% highlight ruby %}
:mySym
puts :mySym # => mySym
{% endhighlight %}

## Blocks
In Ruby, any code contained within curly braces ({}) is considered a block. Blocks are special, because they are often invoked by a function. The invoker is responsible for sending any values to the block in the form of a variable. For example:

{% highlight ruby %}
5.times { |time|    # start of block; value assigned to time by times
    puts time       # prints 0 -> 5
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the variable is passed into the block in a parameter list encapsulated in pipes. Any multi-parameter implementation is comma separated.

## String Formatting
In the context of processing strings or printing to them to the console, Ruby offers a convention that helps with formatting and dealing with expressions as strings.

Within double quotes, the hash sign followed by a pair of curly braces denotes accessing a value. The contents within the curly braces must be a variable or expression that represents a string.

{% highlight ruby %}
player = {"name" => "steebe", "age" => "24", "game" => "GOW"}
player.each { |k, v|
    puts "#{k}, #{v}" # => name, steebe \n, etc.
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Functions
Functions (inherently "methods" due to being defined within a class body) can be called from any object in Ruby, but only certain methods work on certain objects.
Functions can require parameters, and upon invocation _optional_ parameters denoting the argument list.

{% highlight ruby %}
x = "Hello!"
y = x.gsub("lo", "p")
z = x.gsub "lo", "p"
puts y      # => Help!
puts (z)    # => Help!
{% endhighlight %}


### Out of the Box Functions

Function | Caller Type(s) | Notes
-------  | -------------  | -----
_puts_   | System         | Put "arg" prints its argument to the screen followed by a newline.
_print_  | System         | Prints its argument to the screen.
_.times_ | Number         | Iterates for a cycle whose count is **n**, the number being invoked on. If followed by a block, will execute that block **n** times.
_.length_ | String | Prints the length of a string. Does not work on numbers!
_.gsub(arg1, arg2)_ | String | "Global Substitute" replaces all instances of arg1 in the String with arg2.
_.lines_ | String | Converts a string to an array of its contents. Each item represents a block of characters that are followed by a newline.
_.ljust(intArg)_ | String | When called on a string, justifies the string to the left side of the buffer with its argument specifying the amount of padding.
_.reverse_ | String, Array | Reverses the attributes of an object. Does not work on numbers!
_.max_ | Array | Prints the greatest item of an array of numbers.
_.sort_ | Array | Sorts the contents of an array of numbers.
_.join(delimiter)_ | Array | Joins the contents of an array with the delimiter as the separators between each item.
_.each_ | Array, Hash | Returns the contents of an array or the key/value pairs of a hash.
_.select_ | Array, Hash | Returns the contents of an array or hash filtered by a block.
_.count_ | Array, Hash | Returns the amount of elements in an array or hash.
_.keys_ | Hash | Prints the keyset of a Hash as an array.
_.to_s_ |   | Attempts to convert a non-string to a string.
_.to_i_ |   | Attempts to convert something to an integer.
_.to_a_ |   | Attempts to convert something to an array.

### Definitions
As with any robust high level language, Ruby allows for the developer to create their own methods. To create a method in Ruby, the _def_ and _end_ keywords are required to form a block.
{% highlight ruby %}
def myMethod (arg1)
    # method body
end
{% endhighlight %}

### Returns
A custom method does not include its return type in its stub. Instead, it just returns what it must when it must. The return statement can include the _return_ keyword, or it can simply be the value that is being returned. In other words, the _return_ keyword is optional.

### Bang! (!)
{% highlight ruby %}
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 4, 66, 2]
numbers   # => [3, 5, 1, 4, 66, 2]
numbers.sort
numbers   # => [3, 5, 1, 4, 66, 2]
numbers.sort!
numbers   # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 66]
{% endhighlight %}
